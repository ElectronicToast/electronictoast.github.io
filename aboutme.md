Hi, I'm Ray, and I am studying electrical engineering at Caltech. I am interested in applications of electronics, mechatronics, and control systems in varying fields, particularly robotics and aerospace. In my spare time I enjoy building DIY electronics, cobbling together small robots, and 3D-printing.
