title: About Me
---

I am a graduate student studying electrical engineering at USC and a recent graduate (B.S. EE, 2020) of Caltech. I do research in analog, mixed-signal, and RF integrated circuit design with a focus on a wide range of low-cost and portable applications, such as point-of-care medical sensors. 

I am passionate about designing and implementing high-speed, performance-critical systems that span embedded systems, mechatronics, robotics, and a variety of other disciplines.

In my spare time I enjoy building DIY electronics, cobbling together small electromechanical knickknacks and robots, and 3D printing.
