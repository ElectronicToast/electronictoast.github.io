summary: A proof-of-concept for an open-source AR headset

This is a proof-of-concept of a wearable computer that doubles as an electronic vision-enhancing aid, powered by a Raspberry Pi and a 3D-printed transparent screen. 

I seek to turn this prototype into a lightweight, robust, and easy-to-use open-source project that, aside from being an awesome wearable computer for under $100, can also benefit those with visual impairments that are uncorrectable by surgery.
