Everyone has seen the Arduino robot that avoids obstacles with an ultrasonic sensor (Iâ€™ve built one too). How about one without any microprocessors? 

For the Experimental Projects in Electronic Circuits (EE 91) course at Caltech, I built this robot, which autonomously moves and avoids obstacles with no digital circuitry. 

Two pairs of ultrasonic transducers became a pair of ultrasonic sensors through an oscillator and a pair of sense amplifier circuits. A hardware PID controller implementation would compare the received sensor levels and adjust motor power to steer the robot away from obstacles.
