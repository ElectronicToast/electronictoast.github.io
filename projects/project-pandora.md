During my senior year at Caltech, I was asked to be the teaching assistant for a new advanced embedded systems project course, EE 110abc. The course focuses on high-performance and wireless embedded systems development, using the ARM Cortex-M4 architecture in a year-long project. The first quarter of the class covered hardware design and programming with the TI SimpleLink CC2652R multiprotocol dual-core ARM wireless MCU, while the second quarter focused on mesh networking with the TI BLE stack. 

[Pandora](https://github.com/ElectronicToast/pandora) is my implementation of a development board for the MCU as part of the second quarter, with an onboard inverted-F PCB antenna and an SMA jack for an external antenna. Unfortunately, COVID-19 halted all in-person lab work, and the class was unable to finish our development boards.
