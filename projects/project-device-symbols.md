KiCad is a fantastic piece of software, a wholly free and open source, full-featured PCB EDA suite (aside from certain features like panelization...).

 But sometimes you need to draw a nice schematic by itself, and not for a PCB design. I created [this library ](https://github.com/ElectronicToast/device-symbols) of symbols of generic transistors and logic gates. 
 
 This library has been useful for me in drawing schematics and other documentation for homework assignments and projects, such as this differential operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) design for the analog / mixed-signal IC design course at USC.
